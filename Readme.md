## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Three.js
- ES Module Shims
- Web Audio API

## Game Objects

### Players
- Two spherical characters (Blue and Red) with physics-based movement
- Shadow casting
- Collision detection between players
- Smooth movement controls

### Obstacles
- Randomly generated with varying positions and colors
- Increasing speed based on survival time
- Physics-based movement with acceleration
- Collision detection with players

### Environment
- Large ground plane with shadow receiving
- Grid helper for spatial reference
- Ambient and directional lighting
- Responsive camera system that adjusts to keep both players in view

## Game Rules

1. Both players start on opposite sides of the track
2. Control your player to avoid incoming obstacles
3. Players can collide with each other, potentially pushing opponents into dangers
4. The last player standing wins!
5. A player is eliminated by:
   - Falling off the track
   - Colliding with an obstacle

## Performance Features ‚ö°

- Efficient rendering with Three.js
- Optimized collision detection
- Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Smooth animation frame handling

## Future Improvements üîÆ

- High score system
- Multiple character options
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Mobile touch controls
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Visual effects and particles
- Additional sound effects for actions
